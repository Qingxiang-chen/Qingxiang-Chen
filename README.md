      design 
  value: answer, number(input), chance,  MAX and min 
  
     loop1 for test  guess range ,  loop2 for chance , 
     so it should be   loop1 test input > or < answer to get  range 
         loop2 should use  chance ++ or -- to show the chance of user have, I think -- will easier. 
      becase it only have < or >, so if will be used. then the chance user have also need loop, so while or for. 
      
      
      test: 
         error 1: the loop of all can't stop. 
             solution: printf in wrong way
         error 2 : the loop of range can't stop 
             solution: the Max and Min did not have real value , so  I make max = 100 min =1, (range is 1 to 100)
                       then input replace max or min are fixed and not stop.
     
    relfection:  overall lesson: basic input and data
             what  I learn is understand data type, and know the branch, 
             before this project  I want know more about loop, beacuse my personal practice loop cant stop sometime and I cant figure out.
             testing is most hard, if you are right that will be fine, if not, I need spend lot of time to check each line I program and figure where is wrong.
             I think the missing part is postition of loop, it will cause what I hate -loop dont stop. and what can I do is check every    line by my eye.
